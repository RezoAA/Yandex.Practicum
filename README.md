## Data_Science_Projects:
### Certificate: здесь скоро будет ссылка :)
*This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Yandex.Practicum* 
*Udacity online data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data scientist by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects.*

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recommend you to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn thest basic libraries.

## Part 1 Intro to Data_Science
This section focuses on data preprocessing. In addition, the following issues were considered: Working with passes. Determination of abnormal values. Data type conversion. The main methods of searching for duplicates. Working with imperfect real data sets. 

### Project 1: research_borrowers
Project Description

*The customer is the credit department of the bank. It is necessary to understand whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repayment of the loan on time. Input data from the bank — statistics on the solvency of customers.*

## Part 2 Data analysis
Visualization of data using histograms and boxes with moustaches. Studying data slices. Finding relationships of different parameters in the data. Merging tables. Getting conclusions from grouped data.

### Project 2: market_value_estate
Project Description

*You need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. The task is to set the parameters. This will allow you to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.*

## Part 3 Statistical data analysis
The study of objects and their relationships by statistical methods. Samples and statistical significance. Detection and treatment of anomalies. Project. Analyze the tariffs of the federal mobile operator.

### Project 3: determination_promising_tariff
Project Description

*It is necessary to make a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of customers. You have the data of 500 Megalyne users at your disposal: who they are, where they come from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018. It is necessary to analyze the behavior of customers and conclude which tariff is better.*

## Prefabricated_project_1: Analysis of the gaming products market
Project Description

*Completed the first block of courses. It's time to test your knowledge and solve an analytical case.The bottom line is that I am positioned as a data scientist in the online store "Streamchik", which sells computer games all over the world. Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. It is necessary to identify patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.*
