### Certificate: здесь скоро будет ссылка :)
*This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Yandex.Practicum* 
*Udacity online data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data scientist by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects.*

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recommend you to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn thest basic libraries.

## Part 1 Intro to Data_Science
This section focuses on data preprocessing. In addition, the following issues were considered: Working with passes. Determination of abnormal values. Data type conversion. The main methods of searching for duplicates. Working with imperfect real data sets.
